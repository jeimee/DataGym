No pets, no smoking, drinking, or loud parties, no boys spending the night (BYU and Landlord stipulation).  This is a great apartment for students or professionals who are considerate and courteous to the other tenants. There are two off street parking stalls and one is covered, these are first come first serve; the other girls will park on the street or in visitor parking stalls as available.

I have moved to Cincinnati for the summer so this room is available as soon as someone wants it! Though it is usually a shared room, my former roommate has moved, so it’s a private room for much cheaper than you would usually find one.

Glenwood is at the corner of University Pkwy and University Ave, walking distance to BYU as well as to a UVX bus stop to go to UVU. In order to live at Glenwood, you must either be a student or be taking 6 or more hours of institute. Glenwood has a nice pool, ping pong table, pool table, piano, and an active social life. My roommates have a 60” TV that they love watching and reviewing movies on.

I recently moved into foothill place and I’m loving it! My place is gorgeous but its huge and I have decided I am looking for a female roommate. 6 MONTH LEASE $750 +utilities
I am a 36 year old female. I have 1 very well trained Pomeranian. I work over 60 hours a week so I’m not around much and when I am I am a homebody with not many guests over. I prefer a female roommate but open to a male. (no couples. No pets. Small dog ok. No kids)  
someone in my age range that is like minded. I’m a clean freak! So someone that is Clean, tidy and not prioritizing partying. Being neat and clean is a big deal to me so if you know that you don’t keep your house guest or “show room ready” then we are not a fit. Yes I’m serious haha
I have already paid first and last and all the deposits. All that is required is the full months rent of $750+ & a $350 deposit +utilities if move in is on the 1st. Utilities will be due on the 3rd week of the month. If move in is mid month for example, the pro-rated days will be due upon move in also.
You will have your own large bedroom and huge closet with full bathroom to yourself. Attached are pictures of my actual unit and the floor plan and photos of the property. Serious inquires only thank you! Background and credit check will be run by the leasing office with application. Fees will apply so again, serious applicants only.
I hope to find a working professional that is neat clean and laid back like me. I am 420 friendly hush haha we are still in Utah after all... and am cool with a cocktail or glass of wine after a long day of work as I pull at least 70 hours a week but I am a private person and dont like a bunch of random guests over without communicating first about who is going to be in my home. As well as no overnight guests until we get to know each other . Thank you for reading my post and considering applying. I do not discriminate whatsoever so feel comfortable to apply and have a fabulous day!","dogs are OK - wooof,apartment,laundry on site,carport,private bath,private room"

Hi! 

PLEASE NOTE: I have a couple properties listed, so when contacting me, please specify which house you’re interested in (i.e.; the Brown Taylorsville/W. Valley rancher, red Liberty Wells bungalow, tan Millcreek house, etc.). 

I have a few nice bedrooms available for rent in this 5-bedroom/3 bath Taylorsville/ W. Valley home. Each room is single-occupancy and utilities are split evenly among the housemates. 

The rooms are as follows:
1 smaller bedroom with shared bathroom ($475/month)
1 mid-size bedroom with shared bathroom ($500/month)
1 master bedroom with private quarter bathroom ($650/month)

Each room features either nice hardwood floors or new carpet, and enough space for bed, dresser, and desk. The common areas are furnished, but the bedrooms are not--so you'll need to bring your own bed, dresser, etc. 

Neighborhood is safe, quiet, very well-maintained, and centrally located--very easy access to just about everything in SLC (The interstates, frontrunner/trax stations, Sugarhouse, Millcreek, downtown, Liberty Park, Draper/Sandy, the ski areas, etc., etc. are all within a short drive). The house is also just a few blocks from Valley Regional Park—one of the nicest recreation areas in SLC (it includes large grassy park areas, baseball diamonds, running trails, a frisbee golf course, a library, and a recreation center with gym and swimming pool!).

The house is very well-maintained and features hardwood floors, modern central head/AC, a beautifully-maintained front and back yard, covered and uncovered patio seating areas, and plenty of off-street parking (including covered off-street parking). Overall, it’s a really nice place to live! 

What type of tenant I'm looking for: I like people who are friendly, responsible, trustworthy, and clean. This is not a party house; we like to keep it pretty quiet, tidy, and comfortable for everyone. As long as you're friendly, respectful of others, and reliable, then you should fit right in! 

I will require a background check, proof of employment and references. First and last month's rent will be due at lease signing, as well as a refundable security deposit (same amount as the rent)

Roommate needed! Three college age students in need of a fourth roommate! We live in the Four Seasons newest apartment complex! It is so so nice, brand new, and has amazing amenities. 3 bed, 2 bath. You would have your own room with a big closet and a shared bathroom. Comes with all appliances and maintenance is FREE! It is not furnished but me and my group will take care of that with a little pitching in from you. Rent is 345$ a month (if you have a boyfriend or a friend you want to share a room with, rent would only be 275!!!), (utilities not included but you only pay what you use!), NO SECURITY DEPOSIT! FIRST MONTHS RENT IS FREEEE! We got a *smoking deal* so if you decide to sign the lease before July 6th you can move in whenever and don’t have to pay rent until august!! Four seasons also normally requires a 500$ security deposit (phew) but with this deal they waive the deposit! All you have to do is pay a 40$ application fee to sign and that is essentially your first months rent AND security deposit. You just don’t find anything like this.

Amenities are out of this world. Big pool, 3 hot tubs, grills, community garden, and a free service every month of either a massage OR mani pedi ($50/month value!!) This apartment also has tons of free parking, and is a 4 minute drive to campus and only 10 on a bike!

My roommates and I are very very chill people, non-lds, and the funnest group you could live with. This is also a co-ed household, 2 girls and 1 boy. Contact me (Gracie) at  show contact info

Peaceful room with newly-remodeled private bathroom available as soon as July 3rd. Couples ok.
Month-to-month rent. Close to downtown. Safe neighborhood. Room is $700/mo for one person, $800/mo for a couple. Utilities (including internet) will be split equally among housemates. Security deposit is $700 and will be refunded when you move out.

House has a sweet backyard with a great covered porch area to hang out. Washer/dryer on site. Cozy living room and spacious kitchen. Your room and bathroom is on the opposite side of the house from mine, so there's a lot of privacy. You'd share the house with me and my dog (she is completely housetrained and calm and sweet). No other pets please – non-negotiable. Plenty of parking on the street. 5 min walk to Lincoln Park. If you're into gardening, there's space for that.

I'm 26, female, artistic, friendly, easygoing, and queer. I like to keep the house clean, especially the kitchen, so if you're interested in the room please be down to do your dishes. I'll take care of all the yard work. I'm not a partier, I don't smoke, I do drink on occasion. I'm okay with weed smoking but landlords prefer no cigarette smokers. 

Please have a full-time job and be able to provide references. You'll have to submit an application with a $29 non-refundable fee which will include a background check and credit check. Although the lease is month-to-month, I prefer to rent to someone who is intending to stay for at least 6 months or a year. 

If you're interested, please email me with a little info about yourself. Please include your name, age, gender, what you like to do for fun, what you do for work, and anything else you think is relevant.

Pictures of room show it with landlords stuff in but it will be completely clean and I will take new pics on the 1st.
